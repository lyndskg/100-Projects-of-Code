A super simple implementation of a HTTP web server &mdash; outputting "Hello, World" (or any other arbitrary text of your choosing) in its response body. Built using the "socket" Python library, as implemented in [Blog Post by Ruslan](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/).


## To Do

Nothing! This program is fully implemented and tested.

## How to Run

Run HTTPServer.py with Python3 on the command line. It should look something like this:

```
$ python3 HTTPServer.py
Serving HTTP on port 8888 ... 
```

Then, simply navigate to your Web browser's address bar and type in the URL "http://localhost:8888/hello." S
