## Overview 

<ins>__Language__</ins>: Python3  

<ins>__Completed on__</ins>: February 3rd, 2023

A simple simulation of the classic arcade snake game using the cross-platform "Pygame" Python module. Runs as a fully contained application within Terminal. Implementation was assisted by guides from [Edureka](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/) and [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame-module/).


## To Do

Nothing! This program is fully implemented and tested.

## Usage

Run HTTPServer.py with Python3 on the command line. It should look something like this:

```
$ python3 HTTPServer.py
Serving HTTP on port 8888 ... 
```

Then, simply navigate to your Web browser's address bar and type in the following URL: "http://localhost:8888/hello." That's it!
