## Overview 

<ins>__Language__</ins>: JavaScript

<ins>__Completed on__</ins>: February 2nd, 2023

A JS plug-in used to check how strong a given password is. Built using the npm package ["hsimp-main"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hsimp-main?activeTab=explore) for Node.js. Code is borrowed from the MIT-licensed "How Secure Is My Password?" (HSIMP) project &mdash; as deployed via the official Security.org toolkit [here](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), with source code available at [this Git repo](https://github.com/howsecureismypassword/hsimp).


## To Do

Almost fully implemented; needs to be tested and debugged.

## Usage

Run HTTPServer.py with Python3 on the command line. It should look something like this:

```
$ python3 HTTPServer.py
Serving HTTP on port 8888 ... 
```

Then, simply navigate to your Web browser's address bar and type in the following URL: "http://localhost:8888/hello." That's it!
