# 98 Projects of Code

Inspired by [aceking007's GitHub post](https://github.com/aceking007/100ProjectsOfCode), I'll be attempting to program all 98 of the 100 projects I could identify from their list &mdash; using a variety of different languages (especially ones I'm not as familiar with!!). 

I'm hoping to gain some more experience with languages I'm currently weak at (or have never used), get some general coding practice to refresh and reinforce my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, and increase the breadth of my overall coding expertise via completing such a diverse array of projects.

## Progress (6/98)
I created this repository on 1/20/2023.

<ins>__Latest Update__</ins>:
As of February 3rd, 2023, I have completed (...or at least have made a good faith effort at...) 6 out of the 98 projects listed below.

<ins>__Primary Language Breakdown__</ins>: (6)
   - Python (3)
   - JavaScript (1)
   - PHP (1)
   - Ruby (1)

1. FTP Client
2. [HTTP Server](https://github.com/lyndskg/98-Projects-of-Code/tree/main/02.%20HTTP%20Web%20Server) ✓
   - Python (1/20/23). A super simple HTTP web server outputting "Hello, World" (or any other arbitrary text) in its  response body. Built using the "socket" Python library, as implemented in [Blog Post by Ruslan](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/).
3. Web Scraper
4. [Port Scanner](https://github.com/lyndskg/98-Projects-of-Code/tree/main/04.%20Port%20Scanner) ✓
   - Python (2/3/23). A light-weight yet multi-threaded port scanner with both UDP and TCP functionalities. Probes a server or host for open, closed, and/or filtered ports. Can be run on specific ports; otherwise, defaults to the top 1000 ports. Built using the "socket" Python library, with additional support from "threading" and "queue" libraries for threaded programming intents. Largely inspired by [PieScan](https://github.com/m57/piescan/blob/master/piescan.py) and [KPorts](https://github.com/remzmike/python-kports-portscanner/blob/master/kports.py).
5. Packet Sniffer
6. P2P File Sharing
7. Web Search Engine
8. Bandwidth Monitor
9. Product Landing Page
10. [Create Your Own Blog](https://github.com/lyndskg/98-Projects-of-Code/tree/main/10.%20Blog) ✓
   - Ruby (2/3/23). Employing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) &mdash; a static site generator written in Ruby &mdash; in order to build a simple, HTML-based online blog. Jekyll takes content written in Markdown files, passes it through specified templates, then spits it out as a complete static website &ndash; ready to be served. Guides on how to use Jekyll to blog can be found [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), [here](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/jekyll-blog), and [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging/).

URLs are saved in a SQL database and accessed via the [PDO extension](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/php-tutorial/pdo-in-php); moreover, HTML responses are generated for all saved URLs. Implementation was strongly guided by the [Shorty](https://github.com/mikecao/shorty) installation.
